Libyan rebels have recaptured four more towns and are moving quickly towards Muammar Gaddafi's heartland of Sirte.

They seized the eastern coastal towns of Ras Lanuf, Brega, Uqayla and Bin Jawad after pro-Gaddafi forces withdrew, under pressure from allied air strikes.

The rebels had recaptured the port of Ajdabiya on Saturday.

US, French, British and other allied aircraft started attacking Libyan government troops eight days ago.

The military coalition was assembled after the UN Security Council authorised action to protect civilians.

Nato members met in Brussels on Sunday evening and agreed to take over command of military operations in Libya from the US-led coalition, diplomats said.

Reclaiming lost ground
Rebel forces have now advanced as far as Nofilia, just 100km (60 miles) from Sirte.

"Gaddafi's forces are now scared rats," Mohammed Ali el-Atwish, a 42-year-old rebel fighter in Bin Jawad, told AFP news agency.


The rebels have been encouraged by their success and say they will keep moving westwards
"They are dropping their weapons and uniforms and dressing as civilians. We are no longer concerned about Gaddafi's forces at all."

In recorded interviews released on Sunday, US Defence Secretary Robert Gates and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said the US had largely accomplished its goals in Col Gaddafi's Libya.

"We have taken out his armour," Mr Gates said, adding that the US would soon relinquish its leading role in the coalition.

Mrs Clinton said: "We're beginning to see, because of the good work of the coalition, his troops begin to turn back toward the west - and to see the opposition begin to reclaim the ground they had lost."

France says its aircraft destroyed at least five Libyan government jets and two helicopters on Saturday night at a government air base near rebel-held Misrata, which has become a key focus for the battle in western Libya.

Misrata is the only significant rebel-held city left in the west, and has been under heavy bombardment for days.

On Sunday, a resident of the city told Reuters the city and port area were under attack again. "We don't know whether it's artillery or mortars," he said.

Reports from Misrata say food, water and medical supplies are running low.
